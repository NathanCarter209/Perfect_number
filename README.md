# Perfect_number
This is a code for whether the number is perfect or not.
```
int i, sum = 0, num;
printf("\n Enter your number : ");
scanf("%d", &num);
```
In this part we initialise the values for the code and we take a **num** as a user defined.
```
for ( i = 1; i <= num/2; i++)
```
In this part we need to initialse a loop here so that the loop will keep on checking the number for perfect number till 100 
to check perfect numbers above 100 we use Euclidâ€“Euler theorem. So lets not use this theoram in this code.
```
if (num%i == 0)
        {
             sum += i;       
        }
```
In this part we 
```
if (sum == num && num > 0)
    {
        printf("%d is the PREDECT NUMBER\n", num);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d is NOT A PERFECT NUMBER\n", num );
    }
```
In this part we need initialise if-else statement for 1
